# Week 1 â€” App Containerization


I ran the command line docker build and pushed to my docker hub account. the image is **iaminnocent/crudder-backend:latest**

I also learnt a bit about the benefit of multi stage build in docker, as it helps with segmenting the different build stages. I split the backend Dockerfile to try out multi stage build.

Then for health check, I added a health check endpoint in the backend api. I had to modify the Dockerfile to install netcat, so I could call the endpoint in the container  as it was not available, to perform the health check. I then added the healthcheck command in the backend service of the docker-compose.

I researched a few practices for Container Security and Dockerfile out of which I switched out from building and running the docker image and container for the backend api Dockerfile as **root** user to **appuser**> I also set the file system access to ***read only*** for the frontend service of the docker compose.
